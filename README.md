# Capstone Project @neuefische
This is my capston project from the twelve week Data Science Bootcamp at neuefische in Hamburg and should show what I learned in the last three months. I am new to Data Science and had almost no previous knowledge in programming and mathematical models, so there was a lot to learn... For my project I have selected the following kaggle competition.

# Google-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Prediction

For many businesses only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

In this competition, youâ€™re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
